# Terraform - Agent Guidelines
- The project is using OpenTofu instead of Terraform.
- For any change, if relevant, first create a Terratest test that will test this change. Verify that it fails.
- After implementation, validate it using `task check-llm` command inside the appropriate stack folder.
- After successful result, run `tofu plan` with appropriate grep filter to verify exact field changes.
- Verify that resources specified in the root module (input main.tf or terragrunt.hcl) are visible in the plan.
- Make sure all tests pass.
- At the end, run `task fmt` to automatically format modules and `task docs` to generate documentation.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Prefer creating resources with awscc provider (AWS Cloud Control API). Use aws provider for data resources only. AWS cloud control is autogenerated from AWS CloudFormation resource providers, so feel free to use cloudformation template reference to figure out the proper parameters.
- Resource naming: this for single resources, plural for collections (e.g., awscc_ec2_vpc.this, awscc_ec2_subnet.this).
- Variable names: snake_case, descriptive and consistent with AWS terminology.
- Avoid modifying variables structure inside the root module (input main.tf or terragrunt.hcl) unless explicitly asked.
- Tags: merge common_tags with resource-specific tags using merge() function.
- Use for_each for multiple resources, count for conditional single resources.
- When terraform logical id consists of multiple parts, separate them with underscore.
- Create local variables in locals.tf for complex calculations and data transformations.
- Put data sources into data.tf.
- Put Terraform check statements into checks.tf.
- Put outputs into outputs.tf. Return full resources from provider when relevant. When there is a resource with "tags" attribute, convert it from list of maps into a single map.
- Cleanup unused variables and statements in terraform files when making changes.
- Avoid changing reference.md files manually, use `task docs` to regenerate them
